go run main.go

**Open your browser or use curl:**

curl http://localhost:3000/ping

**Note:**
Server listening on port 3000
…that means your Go (or Node.js) program is now running a server and actively listening for incoming HTTP requests on that port.

Any client (browser, curl, Postman, or another program) can send requests to http://localhost:3000.

The server handles each request using the functions you defined (/ping → "pong", / → "Hello from Go API!").

The server keeps running until you stop it (Ctrl+C in terminal) or it receives a termination signal.

Think of it as opening a “door” on port 3000: the server sits there waiting for anyone to knock.

If you want, I can make a simple diagram showing how the client talks to your API server. It helps visualize this better. Do you want me to?
